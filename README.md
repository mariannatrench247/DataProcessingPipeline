# Overview 
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any data science or machine learning project. This process involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a suitable format for analysis or model training. The goal is to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and properly formatted to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.
  I will take data from several sources and transfer it to a destination: analytics tools or cloud storage, where the raw data is then converted into useful information, generating key insights. For this repository, I will be using Python to achieve my end to end data processing as the data will be fitted for machine learning models written in Python using Pytorch and Tensorflow. 

# 1. Data Collection 
- Description: Describe the sources of your data (e.g., CSV files, databases, APIs) and how they were obtained.
- #Tools#: Mention any libraries or scripts used for data collection (e.g., `requests` for API calls, `pandas` for reading files).
- Example: 
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv('data/raw_data.csv')
# 2. Data Cleaning 
- Handling Missing Values#: Explain how you dealt with missing values (e.g., removing rows, filling with mean/median).
- Example: 
  ```python
     df = df.dropna()  # Drop rows with missing values
     # Or fill with mean:
     df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)
- Removing Duplicates: Describe how duplicates were removed.
  ```python
  df = df.drop_duplicates()
- Outlier Detection and Removal:Specify methods used to identify and handle outliers (e.g., IQR, Z-score).
# 3. Data Transformation 
- Scaling: Mention if and how features were scaled (e.g., Min-Max Scaling, Standardization).
    ```python
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    df[['feature1', 'feature2']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['feature1', 'feature2']])
- Encoding Categorical Variables: Explain how categorical variables were handled (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
    ```python
    df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['category_column'])
- Feature Engineering: f['new_feature'] = df['feature1'] * df['feature2'].
# 4. Data Integration
- Description: Describe how different data sources were combined (e.g., merging multiple datasets, joining tables).
   ```python
   df_combined = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key_column')
# 5. Data Reduction 
Dimensionality Reduction: If applicable, explain how you reduced dimensionality using methods like PCA.
'''python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
df_reduced = pca.fit_transform(df)

Feature Selection: List the techniques used for feature selection (e.g., correlation analysis, mutual information).

# 6. Data Splitting 
 how the data was split into training and testing sets.
'''python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
train, test = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 7. Final Preprocessed Data 
 final structure and format of the preprocessed data. 

# 8. Automation and Reproducibility 

Scripts:  
Instructionshow to execute the preprocessing pipeline (e.g., python preprocess.py).
Configuration: Mention if there are any configuration files (e.g., .env files, config.yaml).
